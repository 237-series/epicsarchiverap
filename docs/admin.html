<h3>Scripting</h3>
For bulk operations, most administrators will almost find the scripting interface useful as well.
Every action in the UI (in addition to a few that are not exposed in the UI), is accessible from within scripts - please see the <a href="details.html#scripting">details</a> page for more info.
Click <a href="api/mgmt_scriptables.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of business logic accesible thru scripting.
There are also many scripting samples in the <code><i>tomcat_mgmt</i>/webapps/mgmt/ui/help/samples/</code> folder.

<h3>Monitoring</h3>
Here are some aspects of the EPICS archiver appliance that should be monitored
<ol>
<li><span class="term">Connected PVs</span> - You can use the <code>getApplianceMetrics</code> BPL (see <code>samples/checkConnectedPVs.py</code>) to monitor the number of currently disconnected PVs.
You can then send an email notification to the system administrators if this is greater than a certain percentage or absolute number.
</li>
<li><span class="term">Type changes</span> - You can use the <code>/getPVsByDroppedEventsTypeChange</code> BPL (see <code>samples/checkTypeChangedPVs.py</code>) to watch for any PV's that have changed type.
If a PV changes type, the EPICS archiver appliance will pause archiving this PV until the situation is manually resolved. 
<ol>
<li>You can rename the PV to a new name using the <code>/renamePV</code> BPL or the UI; delete and re-archive under the current name. 
This should now archive the PV using the new type; however, requests for the older data (which is of the older type) will have to made using the older name.
This is the safest option.
</li>
<li>The EPICS archiver appliance has some support for converting data from one type to the other.
This is not available in all cases; but is several cases, you can pause the PV, convert to the new type using the <code>/changeTypeForPV</code> BPL and resume if the conversion process succeeded. 
The <code>/changeTypeForPV</code> alters the data that has already been archived; so you may want to make a backup first. 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Maintaining a clean system</span> - Monitoring connected PVs (see above) is made significantly easier if you maintain a clean system.
One strategy that can be used is to pause PV's that have been disconnected for more than a certain time.
The <code>/getCurrentlyDisconnectedPVs</code> returns a list of currently disconnected PVs and some notion of when the connection to this PV was lost.
<ul>
<li>You can (perhaps automatically) pause PVs that have been disconnected for more than a certain period of time.</li> 
<li>You can (perhaps automatically) resume PVs that have been paused (obtained using the <code>/getPausedPVsReport</code>) but are now alive.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can potentially delete PVs that have been paused for some time and are still not alive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Backing up your config databases</h3>
<div>
Each appliance has a config database; typically a MySQL database. 
This config database contains the archiving configuration; that is, how each PV is being archived and where the data is stored. 
So, it's good policy to back this database up periodically. 
For example, over here, we back this up daily using mysqldump; this is more than adequate.
<pre>
<code>
mysqldump -u <i>userid</i> -p <i>password</i>  archappl &gt; <i>/path/to/backupfile</i> 
</code>
</pre>
 
It is also good practice to validate the backups every so often. 
Most labs have some scripts that perform some basic validation of these backups. Just ask if you need more info here.
</div>

<div class="para">
Note that because the config database contains only configuration, the database itself should see very little traffic. 
In fact, if you are not adding any PV's or altering the configuration in any way, you should not have any traffic on the database at all. 
Each appliance assumes that it has complete ownership of its config database; so it makes sense to have the database as part of the appliance itself.
However, it is good practice to store the backup file elsewhere; perhaps in a location that is redundant and is itself backed to tape.

<h3>Recovering from a lost appliance</h3>
<div class="para">
In case you lose an appliances, you can use the backup of the config database to restore the appliance configuration onto a new machine. 
Simply go thru the install procedure and create an appliance with the same identity as the machine that was lost. 
This should yield an appliance with an empty config database; you can import the configuration into this empty database using
<pre>
<code>
mysql -u <i>userid</i> -p <i>password</i>  archappl &lt; <i>/path/to/backupfile</i> 
</code>
</pre>
Restarting the appliance after this and should pick up the imported configuration.
